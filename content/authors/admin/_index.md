I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the
Department of Language Science at
the University of California, Irvine. For
the past seven years, I have worked in
Dr. Lisa Pearlâ€™s Computation of
Language (CoLa) Lab. My research
focuses on (i) the learning biases
children have, (ii) the strategies they
use, (iii) the hypotheses they form,
and (iv) the underlying
representations they use to learn
about and generate language.
